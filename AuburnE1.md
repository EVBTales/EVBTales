# Auburn Episode 1

## Lost

Pinpricks of liquid chill splashed upon your face rouses you from what was once a peaceful darkness. The sound of millions of pounding spheres of water is now 
impossible to ignore. You cover your face with your arms and roll over, but find freshly turned earth now slick with rain to be what was once your warm bed. 
Finally, you know there is no going back to that peaceful dark place, so you open your eyes. Your vision swirls to the point of nausea and you close your eyes 
once more, but the nausea doesn’t fade.

You listen to the patter of the rain, feeling its icy fingertips grasping at your body, feeling almost peaceful for a moment. The ground rumbles deeply followed by a roar as loud as thunder and cries. Shaken and startled, you now sit bolt upright, your vision clearing enough for the nausea to fade. In the distance, through the rain, you can make out four small figures surrounding and attacking one very large figure very near to the edge of a cliff. 

In fear and confusion at your situation, you decide to run in the opposite direction of the battle towards the safety of the mountain caves behind you. As you stumble off on unsteady legs, the hair on the back of your neck stands up and bumps cover your whole body. Pausing in your fleighing, you look up and hovering not far above you is a horrible winged creature alight with jagged glowing strands. “I thought I had killed you, coward.” It rumbles in a low voice. “But you merely play dead so you can flee and abandon your compatriots. Even us which you hunt have more scruples.” The beast opens its beak and a ball of light begins to form. Your heart pounds in your chest as fear overcomes and freezes you still. 

“Duck!” Behind you, one of the figures that had been fighting the other large beast is now racing to your aide, swinging a large metal chain above their head. You hit the ground just as they let loose the chain and it just barely misses your head. The chain whips through the air and wraps itself around the torso of the lightning bird floating above you. What sounds like a roar emanates from its beak as the ball of light fades and the strands of lightning surrounding it now are sparking against the metal chain.

Scrambling to your feet, you continue to race towards the mountain with the bird distracted. “Where are you going?” you hear from behind you, but you just keep running until you reach the mountain and find a cave to hide in. Finding safety in the shadows, you huddle down and rock on your heels with your arms around your legs. You contemplate the situation, but you have no memory of how you got there or why you were there in the first place. 

You hear squishy footsteps quickly approaching you and your instinct is to continue to flee deeper into the cave. “Rowen?” you hear a call echo around the walls. Finding a large rock on the floor of the cave, you dive behind it to hide from your pursuers. “Rowen? Rowen? I thought I saw . . . Rowen?” The footsteps speed up, coming nearer until a figure appears above you. “Rowen! I’m so glad you are okay.” The figure drops to their knees and wraps their arms around you. You don’t know how to react, so you just sit there, rigid with fear. “Rowen? What’s wrong?” They lean back and you can see their face. Their eyes are filled with familiarity and worry. They seem to know you, but you don’t recognize them. “You don’t recognize me, do you?” You shake your head. Their eyes seem to darken with pain and confusion. 

More footsteps enter the cave. “Carden, did you find Rowen?” Three more figures fill the cave.
