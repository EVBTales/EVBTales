# Auburn Episode 1

## Lost

    Pinpricks of liquid chill splashed upon your face rouses you from what was once a peaceful darkness. The sound of millions of pounding spheres of water is now 
impossible to ignore. You cover your face with your arms and roll over, but find freshly turned earth now slick with rain to be what was once your warm bed. 
Finally, you know there is no going back to that peaceful dark place, so you open your eyes. Your vision swirls to the point of nausea and you close your eyes 
once more, but the nausea doesnâ€™t fade.
