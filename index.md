# Welcome to EVB Tales!

I am an aspiring author and this is my collection of experimental stories that I would like to share. In these stories I will attempt to mess with different types of writing and hopefully produce some types of stories you have never read before.

All of these stories and their characters are created and owned by me. I am also the creater of all artwork on this page and maintain the webpage itself.

It is my endeavor that every week I will post another chapter or short story of verying styles. You will see quite a few sections that are marked "To Come" so I have a lot of ideas that I will hopefully work through. 

I hope you enjoy the content that I am producing and it raises your spirits in this tough time.
