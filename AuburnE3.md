“Keep your sword up, Rowen! Never let it sag like that!” Carden yells at you from the sidelines. You and Onyx are facing off in a duel meant to help you relearn how to use a sword. Onyx clearly has more skill than you do. However the fact that Onyx’s usal weapon is a bow makes it a little bit more even ground. “Angle your body away, Rowen! Not like that, the other way!” 

Ever since Nasall, Carden has been acting very strange, agitated and almost aggressive towards your training. Not wanting to push, you didn’t ask what was wrong, but you knew something was. Whether it was worry about you or something else entirely, you didn’t know. You try to keep up with the orders, but all of this still feels so new to you and you often get it wrong. 

“Let’s take a breather.” Onyx says, slumping down, looking as tired as you feel, and you plop down too, letting your sword lay flat on the ground. 

“That’s no way to treat a sword, Rowen. Sheath it. That sword may be the only thing keeping you alive someday.” With a sigh, you sheath it, then draw closer to the fire where Fable and Sacha are tending the meal in preparation for the oncoming darkness. 

“You are doing good for not remembering anything.” Sacha says to you with a smile.

“You wouldn’t know it by how much Carden is screaming at you.” Fable says underbreath. Carden sends Fable a glare, obviously having heard the comment. 

“I’m trying to restore almost a decade of knowledge in as short amount of time as possible. Our team needs its best fighter and leader back. Haven’t you guys seen the cracks starting to form with the new way we have been working as a team? I’m hoping the doctor in Kadon can help us figure out what is going on with Rowen.” Carden plops down with frustration beside the fire.

“I mean, except for not being able to get any monster parts during our last couple run-ins, which we have more than compensated for with the remains of Amari’s store, I haven’t seen much difference in how our team works.” Fable notes. “I mean, I think leadership might have fallen to me a bit more than normal  . . .”

“You have effectively become the leader, Fable.” Sacha interrupts. “What happens when we have another run in with people we know? They will know something is up with Rowen.”

“I mean, maybe not. Rowen was pretty convincing with the Fallendawn clan, and that was some pretty extreme circumstances.” Onyx pipes in.

“What was up with that anyway?” You ask. “Kieren said something about a loss of honor?”

“We saved the Fallendawn clan from a no-win scenario a few years ago. They were surrounded by a goblin hoard with three of their clan injured and we helped them without their permission, which they saw as a loss of honor since they neither requested nor wanted help with their plight.” Sacha answers. “You knew that it was a loss of honor and offered to overlook it and call it a teaming up, but they didn’t agree, saying their honor was already lost.”
	“That seems a little silly.” You note. Everyone shrugs, kind of agreeing that it was, but it was really just the way of things. 
	“And because Kieren challenged you, that led to even more lost honor on their part.” Fable added. “Makes it all even more silly.”
	As darkness approaches, your meal is ready and soon after everyone lays down to sleep. You had slept quite a bit the previous night in Nasall, so you don’t feel very sleepy. Once everyone is asleep, you decide to pull out the crystal flower you had gotten from the centaur and look it over once more. In the light of the dying fire, the crystal sends shards of light in every direction, letting the light shimmer across its surface before releasing it once more. Where there was once one bloom on the stem now a smaller bud as well. This flower of pure crystal had somehow grown in the complete darkness of Aspen’s saddle bag. You return it to Aspen’s saddlebag then return to your seat next to the dying fire. 

The night air isn’t all that cool, but the heat from the fire is still pleasant and the light it gives off in combination with the light of the almost full moon sets you a little more at ease. You lay down and look up at the millions of stars speckling the night sky, wondering just how many there were and if you had ever known anything about what lies beyond. 

You should just give up. You know you won’t win this. There is nothing for you. The voice has gotten stronger, more sure of itself and now able to speak in full thoughts and sentences. But what it says never makes any sense. You weren’t lying about anything, and the people around you sure knew you even if you didn’t know them as well as you used to. You are happy to call them your friends. They have been taking care of you. And what are you even trying to win? What should you give up according to the voice?

As thoughts continue rattling through your head, they turn once more toward Carden. You knew Carden’s concern for you was valid, everything you have experienced in the last few days of your memory have seemed just as real as other moments. So how come you remember a conversation with Carden that you never had? And could you really talk with monsters, or even understand them? It all seems real enough and has even saved you and your clan a couple times.
	“Can’t sleep?” You look over and see Onyx sitting upright and looking at you across the dim fire, casting weird shadows. 
	“Just a lot on my mind.” You say. “You should probably try to go back to sleep yourself. 
	“Have I ever told you why I joined this clan?”
	“Not that I remember.” Onyx doesn’t laugh at your joke, but continues on. 
	“I’ve always dreamt of adventure. Even when I was little. That seems to be what keeps this clan together sometimes. Dreams. We all secretly dream to do something big together someday. Fable asked me to join the clan after I helped you all kill an earth dragon near my home that was filling our river with many landslides. I felt like the odd one out, so at first I declined. Before you all left my village, however, you came and talked to me about how you and Fable had wanted to be Monster Hunters since before you can remember, especially as monster attacks became more common. You told me that you saw that I had the same drive and wanted me to join. I sure wish I knew what it meant to be a Monster Hunter back then.”

“Do you regret joining us?”

“Sometimes. It has always been difficult being the last to join. The only way I really belong with your group is in our drive. We are all very different people. And to be the only one not in a deeper relationship has always made it a little awkward for me too.”

“Perhaps we should ask someone new to join our group.” You offer. 

“That is no reason to invite someone to join our clan. Besides, we have been just the five of us for about three years now. I feel like the others don’t want anyone new, especially with all that you have been going through. I mean, you are basically a new person right now.”

“Am I really that different?”

“In some ways. You are more timid sometimes, though other times I see the same recklessness you had from before.” Onyx’s eyes don’t leave the fire. “There’s a part I miss in you, though. A part that made you more important to me than I ever will be to you.”

“What’s that?”

“I miss the way you saw the world. Your dream is different now. You’ve lost your drive for adventure for adventure sake. What made you you is now gone with your memory and I’m not sure you will ever be able to get it back. It was your struggles as a child that made you want to be a Monster Hunter. Now you are a Monster Hunter because we tell you you used to be. You had a fire that couldn’t be quenched before. Now you don’t even remember the feeling of that fire. I loved that fire. . .” Onyx takes a deep breath. “I loved you.” Without another word, Onyx lays down with back to you and returns to sleep leaving you alone once more and with even more questions than you had before.

---


Onyx says nothing of your conversation the night before. You consider if perhaps it had been another conversation that only you remember, so decide against asking Onyx and making things even more awkward. You try to put it out of your mind, knowing more important issues should be dealt with first. 

Kadon appears before you in the afternoon light on the third day out from Nasall, an expansive city filled with many buildings of all sizes and people of all kinds. At the very center of the city stands a huge ornate palace. “Welcome to Kadon.” Fable smiles. 

“You guys go find an inn to stay in for the night.” Carden says, pulling ahead. “I’m going to go find a doctor for Rowen. Come on.” Carden motions for you to follow. As you approach the city, Carden pulls out a deep gray cloth from the saddle bag. Carden drapes the cloth over top of their head and wraps the ends around their head as if trying to conceal their face. You find this a little strange, but decide against asking with how touchy Carden has become. 

“Will they still be open?” You ask, following Carden through the maze of streets. 

“Should be. Usually nightfall is the closing time, so we still have a good hour left.” A few more twists and turns and the two of you are standing just outside of a small building with a cross symbol over the door. “This is it.” The two of you dismount and tie off your horses on the picket out front before entering the building.

“Well hello there. How can I help you?” Comes a happy voice. Behind the counter stands a kindly person peering at the two of them from behind large round glasses. 

“Hello. We are in need of some help.” Carden says, stepping towards the counter. “You see, this is Rowen. We and our clan were fighting a thunderbird a few days ago, when Rowen got hit in the head. We thought Rowen had died, but somehow lived through the attack. However, there have been a few things wrong since then.” Carden goes on to explain all that had been noticed that was different from your normal behaviours, including things that were never even mentioned to you.

“I see. Well, let’s have a look. My name is Skylar, by the way, and I am the doctor here.” Skylar leads the two of you into a back room, but stops Carden from entering. “Please wait out here so I can speak with Rowen alone.” Carden seems unhappy with this arrangement, but obliges and sits down in a chair in the waiting room out front. “Well, Rowen, it appears a lot has happened to you in the last few days. Have you noticed anything strange within yourself?” Skylar asks, motioning for you to take a seat in a chair across from the one they take. 

“I mean, I have no memory, to begin with. The first thing I remember is waking up in the rain during the thunderbird attack. I’ve had to learn a lot of things again, even how to talk.” You begin.

“Well, you have made remarkable progress in just a few days if it was truly gone.”

“It’s been about eight or nine days since then, but yeah, I guess. I didn’t remember my clan or how to ride a horse or even how to read or use a sword, all of which I was told that I knew very well before the attack.”

“I see.” Skyler nods, writing something down on a piece of paper. “Anything else besides your memory problems that has been strange or odd?”

“Well . . .” You hesitate before revealing all you have been going through to a stranger.

“You can trust me. Nothing that you tell me will leave this room.”

“Since the attack, I’ve been able to understand what monsters are saying. Even the thunderbird spoke to me. A monster even helped me save some of my clanmates because I was able to understand it.” Skylar’s face is unreadable as you speak of this strange ability. Skylar merely continues writing on the piece of paper. “And there have been some things that only I remember like conversations with my clan members that they claimed we never had. And . . .” You pause again. “I . . . I’ve been hearing a voice.”

“Well, okay then. That is quite the collection of strange things.” Skylar smiles at you, finally looking up from the paper. “One happy thing, though, is that this can all be explained by having the near death experience that you had. There are a lot of things about the human brain that we still don’t understand, but what we do know is that strange things happen to a brain that has been hurt. Sometimes these things will go away with time, but others they will be permanent and it is impossible to say which this case will be. All I can recommend is time and rest for the moment and see how things develop over the coming months.”

“So you can’t do anything for me?” You ask, rather frustrated. 

“Other than a bruised brain, I don’t see anything wrong with you, and the only thing that heals a broken brain is time and rest. I can recommend some herbs that will help you rest better and heal a little faster, but even those will take time and may not cure all of these things you have brought to me. I would also recommend maybe taking some time away from the Monster Hunting business if you can.” Skylar says. “I truly wish there was more I could do for you, but things being as they are, there isn’t much I can do for you.”

You stand and turn to leave. “I’ll take your payment out at the counter.” 

“Payment?” 

“You don’t think I do this for free, do you?” 

“But, you just said there was nothing you could do for me.”

“But I sat down and listened to your problems and gave you a diagnosis. It is my time you are paying for.” 

A little dumbstruck, you walk back out to Carden. “What happened?” 

“Skylar said there is nothing to do but rest and wait to see if I heal. The changes might be permanent.” 

Carden’s eyes sadden. “I’m so sorry, Rowen.” Carden sniffs.

“And Skylar says that we need to pay for this information.” You add.

“How much?” Carden asks without another word.

The two of them work out a price. “One last thing. I’m not sure this is the case with you, Rowen, but be careful of those who have lost their memories. There have been several cases that I’ve heard of where an individual disappears for a whole range of time from days to years and when they return, they have no memory at all of their previous life. It is rumored that their memory was taken by some monster, or maybe even controlled by it. Whatever it is, be careful who you tell that you have lost your memory. They may suspect you of being under the control of a monster.”

With that, you and Carden leave the building with a list of rest and healing remedies to try. “Why did we pay Skylar? Skylar didn’t do anything. Didn’t even give us the actual remedies, just a list of ones that we have to go out and buy on our own. What was the point of that?”

“We pay doctors for their knowledge about the body. Sometimes their knowledge is lacking, but it is the way that doctors stay in business.” Carden explains as the two of you make your way to the inn that the clan had chosen. “We will get these things when we go to the One Stop Adventure Shop tomorrow.” 

The inn is cosy and warm and the rest of your clan has already settled by the fire with a nice hot meal. “What did the doctor say?” Fable asks. 

“Rest.” You spit, rather frustrated.

“Yeah, that was about what I thought they would say.” Sacha huffed. “Feels like that’s all they really say any more.”

“It has only been eight days since you got your head bumped. Maybe you really do just need some more time.” Fable says hopefully. 

“I guess.” You plop down and take a huge bite out of a piece of meat that the clan had ordered for you. 

After a quiet meal, the whole group retires to a set of rooms to rest and sleep, but once again, you have a hard time sleeping as the voice in your head gives you little peace going on day three without sleep. 

Morning is excruciatingly slow to come. After a few hours of restless tossing and turning, you decide to go back out into the main room and spend some time by the fire. The main room is empty in the early morning and the fire has been put out. Not knowing how to start the fire again, you huff, rubbing your arms to warm up a little and sit down at a table. The room is dark except for the moonlight streaming in through the windows, casting tangled shadows through the knots of chair and table legs. The voice still doesn’t let up, calling you names that sound like curses and trying to tear you down from something you don’t understand. 

“I don’t understand.” You whisper to the still night air. “What you are saying makes no sense to me.” 

The voice stops. For the first night in a week, there is silence. You don’t understand?

“Why are you calling me these things? Who are you? Why do you wish me so much evil?”

The voice is silent and says no more. 

“Now you won’t say anything?” You ask, raising your voice a little. “What is it that you want from me to keep me awake for three straight nights?”

The voice remains silent, obviously not going to speak again, at least for now. With a huff, you stand and decide to take this opportunity to sleep while you have the silence. 

---

“So, what all are we needing to do at the One Stop today?” Fable asks with a mouthful of food at breakfast the next morning. 

“Well, we need to get the remedies for Rowen and we need to try and sell some of our monster parts. And then there is restocking of food.” Carden lists off right away. 

“We also need a new quest. We have gone through the handful we had from last time.” Sacha says, flipping through some cards. 

“I could use some new arrows if we have the money.” Onyx pipes in. “I used a lot of my best on that dragon.” 

“It’s going to be tight, but we should have enough if we don’t have to buy too much else.” Fable notes.

When everyone has finished their meal, the group heads back out into the city. In full daylight, the city is bustling and alive with people going about their daily business. The group winds its way through the buildings until you find a large arch in almost the center of the city. The interior of the grand archway appears to be covered with some sort of yellowish film that ripples as if some sort of liquid. “What is that?” You ask. 

“It is the portal to the One Stop Adventure Shop.” Carden explains. “See, there is really only one shop, but because these portals are scattered throughout the human territory, more people have access to it. That is how the One Stop can be as universal as it is.” 

“Where is it really then?” You ask. 

“No one knows. It used to be in the city of Vrona, but one day, it just disappeared and no one has know where it was since.” Fable says in a mystical voice. 

Onyx, Sacha, and Fable all step quickly through the portal while Carden waits back with you, knowing that you are nervous to experience such magic for the first time. Once again, Carden is wearing the head wrap, but you hold back any questions you have about it. “It’s just like walking through a doorway.” Carden says gently and grabs your hand, pulling you towards the soft yellow film. You hold your breath and close your eyes and allow yourself to be led through the strange material. “We are through.” You had expected to feel something to let you know that you were through, but when you open your eyes, you are surprised that it really did feel like walking through a door. 

Around you, the world is completely different. Behind you, the arch you walked through is now part of a huge wall that towers high above you as if it could touch the sky. Inside the walls sits a large building with a happy cottage feel. Off to the right, people mingle out front in a nice little outdoor seating area while others stand in a long line to get into the main building. Beyond the largest building, you can make out several smaller buildings along with acres and acres of open land filled with everything from crops to livestock. There even appears to be even some sort of training ground beyond. 

“Wow.” You whisper. 

“I know. Kyrie has done very well for themself. I know Kyrie rather well actually.” Carden starts as you walk down the slight hill towards the long line to get in where the others are waiting. “We met after I took off on my own to become a Monster Hunter. Kyrie took me in and let me work in the store for a little while before I accepted my first quest.” 

“So you know the owner of all of this?”

“Yeah. After Kyrie’s parents died out on a quest, the store was left vacant. They left Kyrie here alone, so after they didn’t come back, Kyrie built up the store into what it is today. And with just the help of some old magic books. Kyrie might even be one of the most powerful wizards of all time. Maybe even more powerful than Madge Buyu.” 

Joining the rest of the group, you continue asking questions all through the wait in line. “Who is Madge Buyu?” The people ahead of you look back over their shoulders and give you a strange look but say nothing. 

“Madge Buyu is Crowned Tatum’s right hand, taking care of a lot of the problems that pop up with magic. And before you ask, Crowned Tatum is the ruler of the human territory.” Carden explains quickly before you have the chance to get any more weird glances. 

“Rules from Kadon, actually. That palace in the middle of the city, that’s the Crowned palace where all the Crowned rulers have ruled for generations.” Fable adds. “I’m honestly surprised we haven’t heard anything about the heir. It’s been years. I wonder if they have finally given up trying to find them.” 

“The heir was lost?” You ask.

“It’s been at least five years since they just disappeared. No one knows where they are, but at this point, there is no way they don’t think a monster got to them. I’m honestly surprised there hasn’t been an all out quest into monster territory.” Onyx agrees. 

The wait takes less time than you expect and before long, you enter the store proper. The inside seems far more massive than the outside would portray. Shelves upon shelves wind through the inside of the store, displaying a huge array of products. “Hello, how can I help you.” A person meets your group as you enter. Fable moves forward and starts listing off thing things that they will be needing to purchase. “That sounds good. I can go pick those up for you. If you would like to look at our arrow selection, that is five aisles down to your left.” The person smiles and turns to set off. 

“Excuse me.” They stop and turn back. Carden steps forward. “Is Kyrie here today?” 

“Yes. Does Kyrie know you?”

“Can you tell Kyrie that Carden is here and would like to talk?” 

“Of course. I will be back in a moment.” And the person walks away. The group walks down to where the store helper had directed and Onyx takes a good look over the many different arrows to choose from. 

“Carden?” The helper finally comes back with an armful of items that Fable had requested. The helper hands them off to Fable and turns to Carden. “Kyrie will see you. I will take you to the main office.” Then Carden follows the helper out of the aisle. 

“What does Carden need to see Kyrie for?” You ask. 

“I’ve never asked, but they speak together every time we come here. I always figured it was a time to catch up and stuff, but who really knows.” Fable says. Onyx chooses some 
nice arrows and Sacha leads the group to the very center of the store where a large three-sided structure stands with cards much like those that Sacha and Fable have been reading off of posted on every side. 

You are unable to read anything that is written, but the group seems to know where they are going. The group looks over one of the sides very thoroughly. “There is a quest in Dalo.” Sacha points out. “Then we can head down to One Stop portal in Doln.”

“I’m not seeing much else we can take on at the moment, so I guess that’s the best we can do for now.” Sacha takes the card for the quest they have chosen and reads it more thoroughly. 

“Looks like something is eating all of the fish in the lake near Dalo. I think we can handle that.” Sacha says. 

With all of the goods in hand that you need, you step into the line for the counter to pay for the goods. “When will we try to sell some of our monster parts?” You ask. 

“We can do that once we get up to the counter. We will pay for what we purchased and they will send someone with us back to our wagon to see what they can buy.” Fable explains. “But we have to wait for Carden to be done before we can go.” 

This line takes a little longer than the previous one even though it is shorter, but eventually your turn comes. Fable and the person behind the counter haggle for a little bit before settling on a price. “Would you be interested in purchasing an expandable bag?” the person behind the counter asks. 

“How much for one?” Fable asks. The price is obviously much higher than Fable had wanted, so the answer is no. 

“What is an expandable bag?” You ask Sacha. 

“It is a bag that is a lot bigger on the inside than the outside. It means you can keep almost everything inside your bag, so we wouldn’t have to travel with a cart. It is what put this place on the map because Kyrie is the only one who knows how to make them, but they are very expensive.”

“We also have some monster parts if you are interested in purchasing them.” Fabel brings up, scooping up all of the purchased items once more. 

“Well, with how many Monster Hunters there are these days, we have been getting lots of monster parts in here, so unless you have something pretty rare, I don’t think we can buy anything. It is a small subset of people who actually buy the stuff to begin with.” The person behind the counter says. 

“We picked up some pretty rare stuff from Amari’s.” Fable replies. 

“Okay, I’ll send someone over after lunch. Where are you staying?”

Fable gives the person the name of the inn you are staying at and then steps to the side for the next person in line. It is only a little longer of a wait before Carden returns. “Everything good?” Sacha asks. Carden nods, so the whole clan moves out of the shop. 

Once you are outside the shop, Carden begins speaking to the clan. “Kyrie says that something is going on with Crowned Tatum. A Crowned Monster Hunter force has been put together, meaning they can claim any and all bounties, even if they didn’t actually complete the quest.”

“What?” Fable says in astonishment.

“Yeah. They basically have the trump over every Monster Hunter clan. Apparently Crowned Tatum even pulled from Earthstand.” Carden continues.

“Seriously?” Onyx says, equally outraged. 

“What’s Earthstand?” You ask. 

“Earthstand is the highest ranked clan. Well, I guess was. Now they are in Crowned Tatum’s pocket. And with that, they have the power to ruin every other Monster Hunter clan.” Carden explains. 

“Do you think Crowned Tatum will try to unify the clans into one force?” Sacha asks. 

“I don’t think many other clans will stand for that, even if Crowned Tatum tried.” Fable says, thoughtfully. 

Your clan walks back through the gate and back to the inn in relative silence. Once the purchases are tucked away in the wagon, Sacha and Fable begin going through the monster parts in the wagon to see what would be worth offering to the store. Onyx, Carden, and yourself sit nearby, watching them work. No one speaks, everyone deep in their own thoughts concerning the future of the clan, but your thoughts can’t seem to land on which problem to choose, so it flutters between all of them. 

As the sun begins to pass directly above, a child approaches your group. “Are you selling monster parts?” The child’s voice is surprisingly adult sounding, which takes you a little off guard. 

“Yes. Are you from the store?” Fable asks. The child nods. “We have set out what we think you might be interested in.” The child looks over the collection of bottles set before the wagon and takes note of each one. 

“Yes, we will buy these from you. What is your asking price?”

“For all of these?” Fable asks. The child nods. Fable thinks for a moment then gives off a price. After several counter offers, they decide on a price and the child hands over the money to Fable before taking up the bottles into a basket and sauntering off. 

“Well, at least it’s something.” Sacha sighs. “Ready for some food?” The whole group heads inside for the midday meal. 

“So we are just waiting for word from Nasall now, right?” You ask. 

“Yup. And that might still be several days.” Carden says after having taken a sip of ale. “Not much to do but wait here.” Carden tugs on the head scarf. 

“Can we go explore?” You ask. 

“We shouldn’t leave unless we have to.” Fable says. “Besides, there isn’t much to see here. It is mainly dwellings and some small stores with the palace that isn’t accessible to anyone but the Crowned line.” 

“So we just sit here?” You ask. 

“Yup. Enjoy the rest.” Carden says. “You need it anyways.”

---


Five days of little conversation without leaving the inn pass very slowly, but eventually the messenger comes. “You have cleared Nasall of the horrible curse that has been upon it for a generation. You have our thanks.” The messenger monk bows to the group. “I have brought with me a token of our thanks.” The monk motions for you to go outside and see. 

“A cow?” Carden asks with a hint of incredulity. 

“Not just a cow. This is the finest cow you will ever meet.” The monk says happily. “Nasall cows are different than normal cows, but we don’t like telling this to outsiders. It may look like a normal cow, but believe me, it is far more.”

“Okay, what’s so special about this cow?” Fable asks, a little skeptical. 

“Nasall cows can talk and speak much wisdom.” You can tell that none of your clan believes what this monk is saying. The monk, seeing this, goes over to the cow and kneels beside it. “Oh, cow, please tell me, what wisdom do you have to speak of?” The cow turns its head, munching on some cud, but says nothing. “You see, they only speak when they have something to say . . .”

“Yeah, sure.” Fable says. “Thanks for the talking cow.” The monk seems a little perturbed, but gets up, bows once more, then sets off back to Nasall. “Well, what do we want to do with this wise old cow?”

“We could go sell it, I guess.” Carden says, looking the cow over. 

“Or we could keep it with us. It might be good for food if nothing else. And maybe traveling we might get some wisdom out of it.” Sacha chuckles. 

“Okay, I guess we can keep the cow at least until we reach Doln.” Fable says. “Well, I guess let’s get going then.” Everyone loads up and sets off through the town to exit through the other side. 

“We should arrive by tomorrow morning.” Carden says as you exit the city. No one responds, the silence continuing to creep into the group. No attempt at idle conversation was made as it was before. Perhaps Carden is right with the cracks forming in the group. Things feel strained and unsettled. 

In the early afternoon, you begin to feel something off. Not with the group this time, but within yourself. A strange, angry energy begins to fill you, stronger than anything you have felt in your memory. The voice returns, yelling with a renewed heat that had left you to rest for the past week. Your body begins to tense beyond your control and you can tell that Aspen is confused by your body language and stops in its tracks, prancing in place with unease. 

“Rowen?” you hear someone ask, but your focus is not on them. A wave of pain washes over you as your muscles tighten beyond what they should. Your body is rigid, unable to move. “Rowen, what’s going on.” The pressure from the rising anger mixed with the pain and tension in your body overwhelms your mind and everything fades to black.
